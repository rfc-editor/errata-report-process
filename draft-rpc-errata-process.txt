            Current Process for Handling RFC Errata Reports
                    draft-rpc-errata-process-latest

Abstract

   This document describes the current web-based process for handling
   the submission, verification, and posting of errata for the RFC
   Series.  The main concepts behind this process are (1) distributing
   the responsibility for verification to the appropriate organization
   or person for each RFC stream, and (2) using a Web portal to automate
   the processing of erratum reports.  This system was launched in
   November 2007.

   This draft documents the existing system as a means to facilitate
   discussion to revamp how errata are reported, reviewed, and
   publicized.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the procedures and mechanisms for handling
   RFC erratum reports.  The main concepts are (1) distributing
   responsibility for report verification to the appropriate body or
   person for each RFC stream, and (2) using a Web portal to automate
   the tasks for verifying and posting erratum reports.

   This process assumes the organization of RFC publication into five
   document streams [RFC8729]: (1) the IETF Stream, which includes both
   working group and individual submissions plus all RFCs that were
   published before the concept of streams existed (known as legacy
   RFCs), (2) the IAB Stream, (3) the IRTF Stream, (4) the Independent
   Submission Stream, and (5) the Editorial Stream.  Personnel
   representing each stream, called the stream-specific party (SSP), are
   responsible for verifying the erratum reports for that stream's RFCs.

   At the organizational level, the SSPs are:

   *  IESG for legacy RFCs

   *  IESG for IETF Stream documents

   *  IAB for IAB Stream documents

   *  IRSG for IRTF Stream documents

   *  Independent Submissions Editor for Independent Submission Stream
      documents

   *  RFC Series Approval Board for Editorial Stream documents

   In addition, the RFC Production Center reviews editorial errata
   reports from all streams and marks them as verified when possible, as
   per [IESG-Err-Proc].

1.1.  Background on RFC Errata

   The RFC Production Center (RPC) began to collect and post RFC errata
   in 2000.  The idea was to discourage readers from repeatedly pointing
   out the same typos in published RFCs.  This evolved into an errata
   verification and posting process that was a manually operated, email-
   based task.  Errata from this period have been made available in the
   current system and marked as Reported or Verified, as appropriate.
   Generally, the name of the verifier is not given as this information
   was not associated with errata records until the new system was put
   in place.

   Because the number of errors reported turned out to be significantly
   greater than anticipated, and the process of vetting and posting
   required more human resources, a web-based process
   [ERRATA_SYS_PROPOSAL] was created and launched in November 2007.

   Another reason for the current, web-based approach to handling
   erratum reports is that about half the reports are not simply
   editorial, but rather apply to the technical contents of RFCs.  A
   savvy implementer of the specification can often, but not always,
   determine what was intended by the RFC as published, but technical
   errors should be announced somehow.  Furthermore, the posting of
   technical errata for Standards Track documents should always involve
   the IESG, as a matter of correct process.  Technical errata may
   require much review and discussion among the author(s), Area
   Directors, and other interested parties.  (See [HOW_TO_REPORT] for
   guidelines regarding editorial vs. technical classification.)

   We note that allowing technical errata is a slippery slope: there may
   be a temptation to use errata to "fix" protocol design errors, rather
   than to publish new RFCs that update the erroneous documents.  In
   general, an erratum is intended to report an error in a document,
   rather than an error in the design of the protocol or other entity
   defined in the document, but this distinction may be too imprecise to
   avoid hard choices.  For the IETF Stream, these choices are made by
   the IESG and are discussed in their guidelines on errata processing
   [IESG-Err-Proc].

2.  Current Errata Process Using the Web Portal

   To manage and automate the reporting, verifying, and posting of
   errata, the rfc-editor.org website provides a web application
   ("portal").  This web portal allows for a more uniform reporting
   process, eases communication among the parties responsible for
   verification, and automates the posting of erratum reports as soon as
   they are reported.

   There are four possible states for an erratum report:

   1.  Reported - The erratum has been reported but is unverified.

   2.  Verified - The erratum has been edited as necessary and verified.

   3.  Rejected - The erratum was redundant or incorrect and has been
       discarded.

   4.  Held for Document Update - The erratum is not a necessary update
       to the RFC.  However, it should be considered in future revisions
       of the RFC.

   Currently, reports in all states are posted (see Section 2.3 for more
   details).

   For more information on the states and their definitions, and the
   guidelines by which the IESG classifies erratum reports into the
   above states, see [IESG-Err-Proc].

   The Web interface supports the following functions:

   1.  Retrieve -- display all posted errata for a specific RFC number
       or display a particular erratum by its errata ID number.

   2.  Report -- report a new erratum, as described below.  (See
       [HOW_TO_REPORT] for instructions on reporting a new erratum.)

   3.  Edit/Verify/Reject -- used by an SSP to edit the contents of an
       erratum and change its status.

   The following sections describe the process in more detail.

2.1.  Reporting Errata

   A member of the Internet community (the "reporter") navigates to the
   RFC errata page [ERRATA_PAGE], enters the RFC number of the document
   containing the error, and clicks the Search button.  All earlier
   erratum reports for that RFC are displayed.  This includes reports of
   any status (Verified, Reported, Held for Document Update, and
   Rejected).  The reporter is asked to check that the erratum does not
   already appear on the errata page for any given RFC.  This step is to
   prevent multiple reports of the same error.

   The reporter then reports the erratum using a Web form to create a
   report record in the RFC errata database.  The report is composed of
   information provided by the reporter and is supplemented by data
   drawn from the primary rfc-editor.org database.  The erratum report
   record includes the following fields:

   The following information is requested from the reporter.  All fields
   must be filled in:

   *  Reporter name

   *  Reporter email address (Note that the address is provided for
      communication purposes with the relevant SSPs and authors, but it
      is not displayed in the online erratum report.)

   *  Publication format: Text, PDF, HTML (This field is present for
      only RFC 8650 and higher.)

   *  Type: editorial, technical

   *  Section #

   *  Original text

   *  Corrected text

   *  Notes

   The reporter is asked to make a judgment on the erratum type --
   technical vs. editorial.  If the reporter has both editorial and
   technical errors in the same RFC, the two classes of errata must be
   entered as separate reports.  This initial classification is useful
   to the SSP; for example, it might allow technical errata to be
   processed with higher priority than editorial errata, and it allows
   the RPC to verify editorial erratum reports and to note frequent
   editorial errors that could possibly lead to improvements in the
   editorial process.

   With the aid of published guidelines (see [HOW_TO_REPORT]), the
   reporter should make the right technical/editorial classification.
   However, if the reporter does misclassify the report, the SSP can fix
   the classification when logged in as a verifier.

   The reporter should enter a new erratum using the Original and
   Corrected Text fields, as this allows for easier verification.  The
   reporter can use the free-text Notes field to provide the rationale
   or to describe those errata that cannot easily be put into the
   Original/Corrected format.

   When the reporter submits the report, they are shown a preview of it.
   They can choose to edit the report, cancel, or submit.  They must
   successfully navigate a reCAPTCHA in order to complete the report
   submission.

   The information provided by the reporter is supplemented by
   information pulled from the database:

   *  Errata ID number

   *  RFC title and associated draft string (if available)

   *  Publication Date

   *  Author(s)

   *  Category ("status") of RFC

   *  Source (Working Group Name, IAB, IRTF, INDEPENDENT, or Editorial)

   *  Area (for IETF Stream)

   *  Stream (IETF, IAB, IRTF, INDEPENDENT, or Editorial)

   *  Verifying Party (SSP Identity)

   *  URL to the distinct erratum report

   When a report is successfully submitted, a notification is sent via
   email (see Section 2.2), and the report is posted to the rfc-
   editor.org website (see Section 2.3).

2.2.  Initial Notification Message

   Submitting the report triggers an email notification message to
   multiple parties; see the notification lists below.  Including
   multiple parties facilitates cooperation in verifying the error and
   transparency in the process.

   Notifications are determined by stream and type of erratum report and
   are sent by rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org to the following SSPs.

   Note that while SSP email addresses are maintained by the database,
   author email addresses, especially for older RFCs, are often out of
   date.  In these cases, the SSP has the option of seeking current
   author contact information or relying on other individuals with
   knowledge of the subject matter to help determine the validity of the
   erratum report.

2.2.1.  Technical Erratum Reports

   Technical erratum reports are sent to SSPs, and the reporter and rfc-
   editor@rfc-editor.org are CCed.

   IETF Stream:

   *  To: authors, ADs of the area from which the document came,
      document shepherd

   *  CC: reporter, working group, rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org

   *  CC: reporter, rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org, RSWG

2.2.2.  Editorial Erratum Reports

   All editorial erratum reports are sent to rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org,
   and other SSPs are CCed:

   Editorial Stream:

   *  To: rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org

   *  CC: reporter, authors, RSWG

   The message includes the information listed in Section 2.1.

2.3.  Posting Erratum Reports

   As soon as an erratum report is submitted, it is available online as
   described below.  The erratum report is marked Reported until its
   state is updated by verifiers as described in Section 2.4.  Duplicate
   and junk reports are available and marked as Reported only until they
   are deleted from the database by the RPC.

   In this document, posting an erratum report means that:

   *  The report can be discovered through the RFC errata search page:
      https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata.php (https://www.rfc-editor.org/
      errata.php).

   *  A link to the RFC's errata page appears on the following:

      -  the results of the RFC search engine: https://www.rfc-
         editor.org/rfcsearch.html (https://www.rfc-editor.org/
         rfcsearch.html).

      -  the RFC's info page.  For example, see https://www.rfc-
         editor.org/info/rfc2119 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/
         rfc2119).

      -  On the HTML format of the RFC.  For example, https://www.rfc-
         editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/
         rfc2119.html).

      -  On the datatracker status page for the RFC.  For example,
         https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2119/
         (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2119/).  The datatracker
         learns that at least one erratum report exists via
         https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-index.xml (https://www.rfc-
         editor.org/rfc-index.xml) and sets a badge on the RFC's
         datatracker status page.

   All erratum reports for a single RFC, except for obvious spam
   reports, are posted in the following order:

   *  Verified Technical

   *  Verified Editorial

   *  Held for Document Update Technical

   *  Held for Document Update Editorial

   *  Rejected Technical

   *  Rejected Editorial

   *  Reported Technical

   *  Reported Editorial

   All erratum reports are also available at https://www.rfc-editor.org/
   errata.json (https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata.json).

2.4.  Verifying Erratum Reports

   The initial notification message starts the verification process.

   The RPC determines the validity of editorial erratum reports and also
   handles any junk or duplicate reports, whether they are labeled as
   editorial or technical.

   Junk erratum reports contain bogus content in the Original text,
   Corrected text, and/or Notes fields.  The RPC deletes such a report
   from the database and sends an email message to all recipients of the
   report notification, except for the reporter, notifying them that the
   report has been deleted.

   If an erratum report duplicates an existing report, the RPC deletes
   the report and sends a reply-all to the notification message to say
   the report has been deleted.

   The SSP and the authors are expected to determine the validity of any
   technical erratum report, by whatever procedure the SSP or the stream
   owner determines.

   The RPC does not track the verification process for technical erratum
   reports.  The SSP, not the author(s) or the RPC, has final
   responsibility for verifying or rejecting each technical erratum
   report.  This helps to avoid a great deal of complexity and
   confusion.

   Each SSP has a login account on the errata portal to edit and verify
   erratum reports.  The SSP identity is added to the record and the
   individual is able to edit, verify, hold, or reject each erratum.

   The Notes field allows reporters to submit information in any fashion
   they like, so there is a possibility of multiple errors being
   reported in this field.  The SSP is able to split the report into
   multiple records to maintain one record per erratum report, as
   necessary.

   Some erratum reports require significant email discussion between the
   reporter and the author(s) and/or SSPs (in particular, the IESG)
   before the final decision on a report can be made.  The final outcome
   is captured in the erratum entry, and any controversy or explanatory
   material is recorded in the Notes field.

   It sometimes happens that there are errata for errata, i.e., earlier
   postings must be altered.  In this case, the RFC Editor can update
   the report as requested by an SSP or can grant an SSP temporary write
   access to the record to be updated.

   Once verified, the erratum is available for viewing in the RFC's HTML
   format "inline" (for example, see https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/
   inline-errata/rfc3261.html (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/inline-
   errata/rfc3261.html)) in addition to being on the RFC's errata page
   and discoverable through errata search functionality.

2.5.  Erratum Report Announcements

   Like the notification of submissions, the announcement of a verified
   (or held or rejected) erratum report varies by stream:

   Notifications are determined by stream and type of erratum report.

2.5.1.  Technical Erratum Reports

   The announcement of technical erratum reports are sent from rfc-
   editor@rfc-editor.org to the following:

   Legacy RFCs:

   *  To: reporter, authors

   *  CC: verifier, IESG, rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org

   IETF Stream:

   *  To: reporter, authors

   *  CC: verifier, IESG, working group, IANA, rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org

   IAB Stream:

   *  To: reporter, authors

   *  CC: verifier, IAB, IAB chair, rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org

   IRTF Stream:

   *  To: reporter, authors

   *  CC: verifier, IRSG, research group, IANA, rfc-editor@rfc-
      editor.org

   Independent Submission Stream:

   *  To: reporter, authors

   *  CC: verifier, ISE, Document Shepherd, IANA, rfc-editor@rfc-
      editor.org

   Editorial Stream:

   *  To: reporter, authors

   *  CC: verifier, RSAB, RSWG, IANA, rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org

2.5.2.  Editorial Erratum Reports

   The announcement of verified editorial erratum reports are sent from
   rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org to the following:

   Legacy RFCs:

   *  To: reporter, author

   *  CC: verifier, rfc-ed@rfc-editor.org, IESG, IANA

   IETF Stream:

   *  To: reporter, authors

   *  CC: verifier, rfc-ed@rfc-editor.org, IESG, working group, IANA

   IAB Stream:

   *  To: reporter, authors

   *  CC: verifier, rfc-ed@rfc-editor.org, IAB, IAB chair

   IRTF Stream:

   *  To: reporter, authors

   *  CC: verifier, rfc-ed@rfc-editor.org, IRSG, research group, IANA

   Independent Submission Stream:

   *  To: reporter, authors

   *  CC: verifier, rfc-ed@rfc-editor.org, ISE, IANA

   Editorial Stream:

   *  To: reporter, authors

   *  CC: verifier, RSAB, RSWG, IANA, rfc-ed@rfc-editor.org

3.  Role of the RPC

   The role of the RPC in errata processing is to:

   1.  Operate the Web portal.

   2.  Maintain the errata database.

   3.  Make changes in previously posted errata at the request of the
       corresponding SSP, or give the SSP temporary write access to the
       record.

   4.  Act as verifier for editorial erratum reports.

   5.  Remove junk and duplicate reports.

   6.  Track SSP and community requests for various features that will
       make the job of reporting and verifying errata more efficient.

4.  Security Considerations

   It is necessary to have access control in order to process erratum
   reports.  A logged-in SSP is able to edit, verify, or reject any
   erratum report on an RFC that is the product of their stream.  Once
   the SSP has submitted an erratum's final state (Verified, Held, or
   Rejected) and the record entry has been committed to the erratum
   database, the SSP loses write access to it.  This is to prevent
   inadvertent or malicious changes to the database, even if the
   passwords for some SSP logins may become fairly widely known.
   However, the RPC continues to have write access to posted entries and
   can make later changes if necessary.

   The portal uses HTTPS as a reasonably secure login mechanism.  Also,
   the rfc-editor.org website has a signed certificate from a CA, so
   that SSPs have confidence that they are logging into the rfc-
   editor.org website.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
